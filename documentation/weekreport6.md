## What did i do this week?

Had misunderstood the extent of own datascructures so instead of following the plan of implementing a more complex game for kuhns poker i implemented a special SuperArray class for the RPS_CFR.

## Has the program progressed this week?

Yes, for the own datastructures part i think its starting to look good.

## What did i learn this week.

Thank the jesus for pythons documentation.

## What was unclear?

Operator overloading at the start.

## What will i do next.

Implement the KUHNS_CFR to use purely my own datastructures.
